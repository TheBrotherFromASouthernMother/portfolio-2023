                The Green Book Project (Nov 2020 - March 2023) was a crowdsourced-reviews platform (think Yelp) that helped people from marginalized groups 
                find inclusive business and avoid common forms of discrimination such sexism, queer phobia, ableism and racism.

                    Starting as a simple hobby project, The Green Book Project ultimately began during my visit to the

                    After witnessing a shocking instance of caste-based discrimination targeted at the amazing young women of the Kranti House, I reflected on my own experiences with racial discrimination in the Deep South and felt that someone should build an app for that.

                    <p className="mb-6 mt-10 text-m sm:text-xl px-4">
                    The experience galvanized me to build the Green Book Project to help people from marginalized groups avoid discriminatory services and instead support inclusive businesses.

                <p className="my-6 text-m sm:text-xl px-4">
                    As the sole founder of my startup and lacking the experience necessary to attract VC-backing, I learned to code while building The Green Book Project from scratch using technologies like React Native, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL just to name a few. 
                </p>
                <p className="mb-6 mt-10 text-m sm:text-xl px-4">
                    Through user feedback and testing, I built countless iterations of the app until finally launching The Green Book Project for the first time in the Apple App Store in November of 2020. To see how it worked, check out the demo below:

                    After launching The Green Book Project, I quickly assembled a team to help me scale The Green Book Projectâ€™s user acquisition strategy, SEO, and newsletter to build a more substantial following.
                    Within just 4 months of launching in the App Store, I also launched The Green Book Project to Google Play in order to serve our growing group of supporters who wanted an Android version of the app.

                <p className="mb-6 mt-10 text-m sm:text-xl px-4">
                    Through leading this multifunctional product-marketing team I scaled The Green Book Project to reach over 13,000 downloads in the App Store and Google Play, amassed over 7,000 SMS-verified users, built a newsletter following with over 3,000 double-opt-in readers, and raised $51,000+ in crowdfunding support via Wefunder.com.

                <p className="my-6 text-m sm:text-xl px-4">
                    Although my amazing team and I were able to successfully meet our minimum crowdfunding goal, the economic conditions of the market in early 2023 caused us to fall short of our total venture capital funding goal and we were forced to shutter The Green Book Project as a result.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-6 mt-10 text-m sm:text-xl px-4">
                Despite this, I still consider the startup to have been a smashing success in building a dedicated following and yielding countless professional lessons for myself and my former teammates.
